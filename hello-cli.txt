Hello CLI!

Remember, you can use such commands as

$ git remote add origin <remote_url>
$ git push origin master
$ git add <filename>
$ git commit -m "explanation"
$ git status

For branches

$ git checkout <branch>
$ git checkout master
$ git merge clean_up

Hmm, looks like pull requests are better done from the web UI as collaboration. Well, at least I found out!

Cool stuff!!
